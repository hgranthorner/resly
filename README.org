* What it is

This is the start of a resume generation platform that, when provided user employment information (likely gleaned from LinkedIn), can generate specialized resumes for job postings.

* How to run

Currently I'm testing using `libpython-clj` and `rake-nltk` for NLP keyword analysis, so you'll need to have python3 installed and run `pip3 install rake-nltk`.

* Road map
** TODO Getting some basic NLP set up
** TODO Scrape a whole bunch of job postings to get a good idea of what are some commonly used stems
** TODO Try generating stems from my own LinkedIn profile
** TODO Figure out how to weight different pieces of user employment information based on keyword weights in the job posting
** TODO profit
